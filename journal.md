light, Movement, comparaters.  Comparaters take to variable and set them Equal, greater then or less then each outher. Furthermore comparators are able to loop and maniplate the time in which things happens. Comparators help the Qbot swich lights, count up and down, change speeds based off of circumstances, and determine when other sensors take placse. For exsample the a comparator plased with a movement senser can repet or control when the action takes plase.

In coding every character matters and has a meaning. Different codes have different effects and outcomes. If instructions are not followed exactly then different outcomes will follow. In the lesson this week we learn to follow instructions carefully. This lesson helped us be more procices in our work. An additional benefit is that in the future there will be a time when we need to find mistakes in our work and by knowing the basics of how coding should be formatted we will know how better to look for it.

In my own life I use computer sciences daly. One of the areas I use computer sciences is Adobe illustrator. with every line made there is a code that follows. Part of the reason why illustrator is the best Program to use for designing is in its program. In 2024 everything that has to do with technology has coding implemented into it, there is an underline way that computer science affects all of us whether we realize it or not. From how our food is transported, to the houses we live in, to the alarm clocks we wake up to.

Coding improves problom solving skills by breaking probloms down into simple steps to solve them.This way of promble solving is needed in most career. For example,in a health care related job such as a doctors, neruses and physical therapist, there ability to see a promple and exsplain it helps their ppatient understand whats wrong and how to fixs it. Moreover, when the paatient understandes the promple they can colaborate with their doctor to best adress there needs. In conclusion the skills that can be found in computer science jobs, are ones that can be, and are used in different career fields.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the power to greatly improve various fields by making processes more efficient and driving innovation. In healthcare, AI helps analyze medical data for more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment plans. In education, AI tools create customized learning experiences for students, which can boost their retention of information. Moreover, in transportation, AI enhances logistics and delivery through predictive analytics, making operations smoother and improving our daily lives.
On the flip side, the rapid growth of AI brings some serious risks. Job automation is a major concern, as AI takes over roles that humans used to fill, which could lead to job loss and economic inequality. Additionally, algorithms can reflect biases from their training data, resulting in unfair practices in hiring and lending. There are also privacy issues, as the collection of personal data can lead to unauthorized surveillance. Finally, AI can be misused by cybercriminals, heightening the risk of cyber attacks. These challenges highlight the importance of handling AI development responsibly.

Apple's iOS 18.1 update, is a new safety feature that provides additional security features in case an iPhone is stolen or confiscated. This feature implements an automatic restart if an iPhone goes unused for 4 days. This feature is attempting to prevent thieves from rebooting and selling stolen iPhones. Nevertheless, this feature could prove challenges to law enforcement officials attempting to use iPhones for evidence. However, Apple has foreseen these problems but considers it a minor issue in comparison to the security of their users. Stating that “While this may be frustrating for law enforcement storing iPhones in evidence, it also seriously raises the bar for thieves and criminals, which is the whole point.” The future implementation of this update will greatly improve the security and privacy of iPhone users. 18.1 update also serves as a reminder of how advancement in computer science will benefit people at large. Apple understanding that all information on an iPhone—whether it’s your text messages, emails, addresses, or other sensitive date, will benefits from an added layer protection. Apple’s demonstration of problem-solving will help many users feel safe. instilling confidence and peace of mind in users.

In malaw's capital Lilongwe hospital has integrated new safety software that allows doctors to detect if a baby is at risk of having an asphyxia at birth. Doctors are now able to better assess a situation, by knowing  when to remove the baby prematurely if necessary.This integration of this technology was used to save Ellen kaphamtengo unborn child. WHat excites me about this technology the most is how many lives will be saved as a result. Two many fetuses have because doctors could not see in the mothers womb clearly enough to catch  what was happening to the baby. It is my hope that this software will help bring about another way the barit process is easier.

In the digital age, brain rot has been a side effect with the increase of technology usage. To have a clear understanding of brain-rot, one must know how to define it, and its effects. Brain rot is used to define the loss of the ability to critical think. Brain-rot is caused by a costenten domain hit when consuming online content for a considerable amount of time. Effects such as regurgitating unfinished thoughts, mimicking phrases, and trend following are associated with brain rot. In my opinion digital media has had both negative effects and positive. When spreading information, digital media is a great tool, but when it comes to the quality of information as far as having all the facts it falls short. Only when critical thinking is applied to my consumption of digital media is it useful in any regard.

My Favirot thing we did from last sumester was code combat and coding for Minecreaft. 
In the second sumester I would like to work on certifications.
I want to be a Cyber Security Analyst after I leave college and wanted to get a head stat on certification that whould help me land a job. J)obs in this field are looking at Cerification such as (cISm) Cerified Information Seccerity Manager, (CISA) Certified information Systems,and SANS/GIAC. I would like to work on these while in high school.

When faced with change, workers are asked to adapt or be left behind. In the workplace this means when innovation makes work more efficient a number of jobs become obsolete.  This new wave of technology named Ai, is the latest example of innovation making work more efficient than ever through possible. Tasks that use to take teams of twenty people are now being completed by one person simply collecting data and analyzing it with Ai. 
Skills that people spend years developing such as coding, writing, mathematics, problem solving, risk management etc etc, are no longer needed to perform at such a high level to complete a tasks. 
This begs the question how do workers adapt to a system that makes their skills less valuable to their employers. Answer they learn the systems that makes their skill less valuable. By finding ways to improve and utilize this system to their advantage they become essential to the success and development and growth of a system.

The Governments decision to ban Tik-Tok was enacted with the intention of protecting American citizens date. Yet they failed to account for the consequences of taking away an app that people use to express themselves and share information. Many Americans feel as though this was a violation of their freedom of speech, or in some way limited the spread of information. In attempt to still maintain some control over their date, many Americas went to Red Note a social media platform housed in china. Which cause more danger to US citizens. Rather than devolving to social media platforms in America, or meta platforms that limit their creativity and expression; they’d give there date communist-country and abide by its rules. 
Security concerns, may have been the motive behind these events, yet Tik Tok was a safer choice. 
If I was a developer for Tik Tok,  I’d write code that ensures  date can only be collected and used for the user experience rather than government officials. The main thing I’ve learned from this experience is to never take gifts like Tik Tok for granted. It only takes moments for something to be gone. The second lesson I learned was how to approach social media in a better way. Instead of consuming endless videos daily, I can use it the way it was intended to, by connecting and creating  content of my own and telling my own story.
